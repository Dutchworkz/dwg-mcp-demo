# DWG.MCP

The journey to implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in C#.

## How to start
Go to chatgpt and use the following prompt:
```
Give me 10 simple and practical ideas for implementing an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, assuming the MCP server runs as a server-side element.

For each idea, include:

A short description of the server function

A realistic example input (such as a user message)

A sample MCP-style JSON response payload that the server would return

The goal is to demonstrate how the server can support a chat agent using a tool-handling architecture (agent ↔ MCP server ↔ tool). Keep it lightweight, modular, and practical.
```

## Example MCP Server Implementation

Use 1 of the ideas generated by the prompt above to implement a simple MCP server in C# or use your own idea. For reference, you can use the following example:

https://github.com/Dutchworkz/dwg-mcp-example

Changes have to be made in the following projects:
- `DWG.MCP.SSE`: This is the main server project that implements the MCP server functionality packages and functionality needs to be added.
- `DWG.MCP.Client.Web`: Implement the IMcpClient correctly and start building.

If you do nothing the solution will just start and run the server, but it will not do anything useful.


## Important Notes!!!
This sample project is not a full implementation of MCP. It is a simple example to demonstrate how to implement an MCP server in C#. Also it references an
external OpenAI service which is in the appsettings.Development.json file. You can use your own OpenAI API key or any other service that supports MCP.

If you're lucky enough maybe the key will still work, otherwise you have to get your own key.

```
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "openAi": "Endpoint=.....;"
  },
  "openAiModel" :  "gpt41"
```
